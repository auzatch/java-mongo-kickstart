# java-mongo-kickstart
 A project to kickstart a Java-Mongo webservice.


 <br><br>

 ## Purpose

I made a project recently using Java and Mongo and decided that I should create a project with the basic connection stuff setup so I won't have to do it again.

I'll provide some more details as I work on this. (maybe)

Feel free to fork or contribute to this.
